# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
Short EDA project
Exploratory data analysis involves summarizing datasets to uncover patterns, relations and insights.
Steps involved are as following - 
1. Data Cleaning:
   a) Handle missing values
   b) Remove duplicates
   c) Fix inconsistencies
2. Data Transformation:
   a) Changing data type
   b) Normalize data
   c) Creating new features if needed
3. Aggregation and Filtering:
   a) Summarizing data
   b) Applying filters to focus on specific aspects

Titanic Dataset EDA report
1. Overview
    - Dataset containes 891 rows and 12 columns.
    - Missing values handled for "Age"(filled with median) and "Embarked"(filled with mode).
2. Key Insights:
    - Survival rates are synonymous with the class of the passenger(higher the class higher the chance of survival). Example 1st class passengers had more than 60% survival rate and the 3rd class passengers had less than 30% survival rate.
    - Majority of passengers are aged between 20-40 years.
    - A positive correlation exists between fare and survival.
